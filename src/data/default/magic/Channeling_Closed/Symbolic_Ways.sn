A symbol is permanent unless dispelled magically or unless the stone it is placed upon is moved.

The precise size of a symbol may vary. Suggested sizes range from 3" x 3" to 1' x 1'.

The GM may decide to make the attack level of the symbol equal to the type of Symbol spell used. For example, a first level spell placed in a Symbol X would attack as a 10th level spell rather than a 1st level spell.
