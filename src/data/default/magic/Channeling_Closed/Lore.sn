A “curse” is usually something that is detrimental and magical in nature (e.g., delivered from the Curses spell list). The GM may decide that the ''!curses'' spells on this list only apply to
''magical'' curses. Normally, curses may not be Dispelled; they may only be affected by Remove Curse spells.

''Evil,'' ''Good,'' ''Holy,'' ''Of Darkness,'' and ''Of Light'' are defined and discussed in Section 7.1.3.
