An ''aggressive'' action is defined as any action with the intent to directly harm any individual(s). Actions that result in harm indirectly to individuals are not ''aggressive.'' Pulling the lever on the wall to drop an individual into a pit is an aggressive action (the action directly resulted in the harm on an individual). Running away to get help is not an aggressive action.
