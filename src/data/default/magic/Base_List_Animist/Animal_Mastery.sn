When allowed to choose more than one option on summoning spells, the same option may be chosen more than once. For example, with a Animal Summons III, two options are available. This means that if both options are used for the same thing: that three first-level creatures could be summoned, or one third-level creature could be summoned, or one first-level creature could be summoned for four times as long.
