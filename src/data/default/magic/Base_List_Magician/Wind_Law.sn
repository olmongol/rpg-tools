All vacuums created by spells on this list also create a loud noise. The larger the radius, the louder the noise. The GM may wish to rule that all within the radius must make a second RR or be deafened for 1 round per 10 failure (RR attack level equals the radius of the vacuum).
All walls creatured by spells on this list must rest on a solid surface. See Section 7.1.7 for more information on walls (and spell effects on walls).
An elemental creature made of gas will be cut to 20\% activity if it is the target of an Air Stop spell (and the creature fits into the area of effect). A Vacuum spell thrown upon an elemental creature made of gas will result in a Slaying critical on the creature. A Whirlwind has no effect
on an elemental creature made of gas.
