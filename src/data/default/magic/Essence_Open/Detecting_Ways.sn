See Section 7.1.10 for more on detecting invisible.
For the purposes of spells on this list, "evil" is defined as something that causes (or is a source of) intentional suffering, injury, or destruction (see Section 7.1.3).
When using a Location spell, the caster must provide an unambiguous description of the object being sought. This includes a minimum of: the itemâ€™s dimensions (within 10\% of actual size) and at least two other identifying attributes (e.g., color, weight, shape, texture, etc.). Often, it will take more than two other attributes to make the description "unique" (i.e., no other item with range can possibly match the description).
