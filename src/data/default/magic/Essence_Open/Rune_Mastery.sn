Rune Paper is a special prepared paper, designed to hold enchantments. After the rune is read from the paper, it fades from the paper. The paper may then hold another rune.
The attack level of a rune is the level of the spell that is put into the rune. If the spell is an elemental attack, the reader's appropriated Directed Spell OB is used.
See the Rolemaster Standard System for more information on how to use runes.
