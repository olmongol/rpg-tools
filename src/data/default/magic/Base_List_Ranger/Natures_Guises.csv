Lvl,Spell,Area of Effect,Duration,Range,Type,Description
1,Hues,caster,1 min/lvl,self,U,Allows caster to take on the physical coloration of any 1 organic object. The caster must be in contact with object when the spell is cast.

2,Shade,100'R,10 min/lvl,touch,E,All shadows in the area of effect deepen. All Hiding manuevers gain a bonus of +25 (+10 to all Stalking manuevers).
3,Freeze Liquid,1 cu'/lvl,C,10',F,"Up to 1 cubic foot of liquid per level is cooled to freezing at a rate of 1 cubic foot per round. This will not drop a liquid's temperature below -20 F / -29 C (thus, liquids with a freezing point below -20 F / -29 C will only get cooler)."
4,Silent Moves,caster,1 min/lvl,self,U,"Caster can move silently, so long as he does not create a sound originating more than 1' from his body. In many situations, this will give a +10 to +50 bonus (GM discretion) to Stalking and/or Hiding attempts."
5,Self Cloaking,caster,C,self,U,Caster blends into surrounding terrain. This results in a +75 bonus to Hiding attempts. Caster may not move (appreciably) without loosing this bonus.
