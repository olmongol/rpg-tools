The caster must be outdoors to cast the spells from this list.
When summoning animals, the caster can specify a specific type of animal (bird, squirrel, deer, etc.). An animal of the specified type must exist within the region and the animal must be able to reach the caster within the specified time (this is usually a range of about 20 miles). One animal of the specified type will be summoned. If more than one animal exists, a random animal is summoned (not necessarily the closest). The animal will take 10+d100 minutes to arrive. The summoned animal must leave when the spell expires. If the spell is cast again, a different animal will be summoned.
For the duration of the spell(s), the animal(s) summoned will ignore their natural instincts For example, if a creature is summoned for warmth and a creature is summoned as a guardian, the two creatures will not be antagonistic to each other (regardless of their natural instincts towards each other).
If a summoned animal is attacked, it will attack back in its natural fashion (and will no longer be under the influence of the spell). However, this violates the "trust" of the animal (see below).
The animal summoning spells on this list require that the caster has done nothing to violate the trust of the animals in the area. If this trust is violated, the summoning spell types change to Fm and all animals will now get an RR (+50 mod) to resist (e.g., harming a Summoned animal would be a violation).
For the Prayer spells on this list, the caster is required to pray for at least one minute. The exact amount of time needed will vary from deity to deity (GMâ€™s discretion). The weather will appear over the course of of 1-10 hours. The caster can cast no more than one of each Prayer type per day. The chance of the weather appearing is modified by -30 if the weather does not normally occur in the region (at this time of year) or by +30 if the weather is very common in the region (at this time of year). Once summoned, the weather will run its natural course.
