When using the Locate Object spell, the caster must providean unambiguous description of the object being sought. Thisincludes a minimum of: the item’s dimensions (within 10% ofactual size) and at least two other identifying attributes (e.g.,color weight, shape, texture, etc.). Often, it will take more thantwo other attributes to make the description “unique” (i.e., no other item within range can possibly match the description).
