When using the Locate Object spell, the caster must provide an unambiguous description of the object being sought. This includes a minimum of: the item's dimensions (within 10\% of actual size) and at least two other identifying attributes (e.g., color weight, shape, texture, etc.). Often, it will take more than two other attributes to make the description ''unique'' (i.e., no other item within range can possibly match the description).
