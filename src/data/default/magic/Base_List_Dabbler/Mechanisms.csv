2,Tune,1 object,---,touch,U,"When this spell is cast upon a machine, the machineâ€™s efficiency will return to its original level. For example if cast upon a rusty lock, the lock will return to its original non-rusty operational level."
3,Jam I,1 trap,---,touch,U,"This spell has a 50\% chance of jamming the target mechanism (e.g. trap, lock, machine, etc.). If the target mechanism is jammed, there is only a 5\% chance that the target mechanism operates normally when used/triggered normally (check separately each time the mechanism is used). For example if this spell is cast upon a pressure plate in the floor (that will drop a portcullis when someone steps upon it), there is a 5\% chance the mechanism will trigger each time someone walks over it."
4,Unlock I,1 lock,---,touch,U,"This spell has a 30\% chance of opening any nonmagical lock. If the lock is not unlocked, there is a 10\% chance that any traps associated with it are set off. Rolls are open-ended and the sophistication of the lock may modify the roll. See Section 7.1.29."

6,Operate I,1 machine,1 min/lvl,touch,U,"As Unlock I except this spell has a 30\% chance of operating any non-magical machine in its normal capacity for the duration of the spell.

7,Detect Active Power,5'R,1 min/lvl (C),self,P,"For the duration of this spell, the caster will be aware when any active magic is in the area of effect. The caster will not know what the magic is or where it is; only that it is in the area of effect. For example a Dabbler with this spell active can move down a passageway. The moment he gets near magical symbols on a door he will be warned of active magic in the area (and perhaps the spell casters in the party can set out to find the source)."
