2,Study Patsy,caster,---,self,P,"[RR Mod: -50] When this spell is cast on a person, it remains active for 24 hours. After 24 hours has passed (but before another 24 hours has passed), the caster must cast this spell again on the same person. During the time the spell is active, it is recording information concerning the activities of the person. When the spell is cast the second time, the information about those activities is revealed to the caster. This information is used for spells later on this list and spells on other lists (see the Misdirections and Disguise Mastery spell lists). The caster can only have one “patsy” studied at a time."
