Voice and Words spells will only work on non-enemies (i.e.,those that are not actively hostile to the caster).\\\\Voice and Words spells increase favorable reactions. This effect lasts 1 hour per level of the caster after the caster stops\\\\speaking. After this duration, the target's natural tendancies and reactions will take over. Note that most targets will continue to believe the caster even after the spell has lapsed.\\\\Any target who resists a Voice or Words spell by more than 50 will realize that the caster was using magical influence.
