1,Repel Undead I,varies,1 min/lvl,100',F,"Causes Undead to flee or disintegrate. All Undead have a class assigned to them. This spell will affect 1 point of Undead (Class I Undead count as 1 point, Class II Undead count as 2 points, etc.). Animated Dead (see the Evil Channeling List, Necromancy) are treated as Class I Undead and are not entitled to an RR (i.e., they automatically disinte- grate if the spell does not fail). Creatures & Monsters provides complete descriptions of the different types of Undead. Each target is entitled to an RR. If the target fails the RR by 50 or less, it will flee (if the target cannot flee, it will remain motionless). If the target fails by more than 50, it disintegrates. One Base Attack Roll is applied to all targets. For the purposes of RRs, if no class is given for an Undead, use the following table to determine its class. \\begin{tabular}[t]{cccc}\\textbf{Level} & \\textbf{Class} & \\textbf{Level} & \\textbf{Class}\\\\ 1-2 & I & 9-12 & IV\\\\ 3-5 & II & 13-15 & V \\\\6-8 & III &16+ & VI\\\\\\end{tabular}The RR of any single Undead can be modified by concen- trating the effects of the spell on that target. For each additional point of the spell allocated to a target (beyond those normally needed to affect it), that target's RR is modified by -5. Thus, Repel Undead V could affect five Class I Undead with no RR modifier or one Class I Undead with an RR modifier of -20 to each or one Class II Undead with an RR modifier of -5 and two Class I Undead with no RR modifier or any combination of targets providing no more than 5 points were allocated"
