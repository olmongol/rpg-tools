For all spells that affect Undead, GMs may want to give modifications to certain very powerful undead. See Creatures \& Monsters for a complete listing of Undead. A caster can only attempt to repel a given Undead once per level.\\ \begin{itemize} \item See Section 7.1.30 for more on curses and removing them.\item Demons are assumed to be beings of another plane who are brought into the caster’s plane through the use of an elemental force (one not of the Demon’s plane). Thus, the Demon and caster do not make RRs during the summons. See Creatures \& Monsters for a full description of Demons. If no type for a Demon is given, use the following table to determine a Demon’s type. The GM may wish to this type system to account for the types of Demons he wishes to use in his world. \end{itemize} \vspace{5pt} \begin{tabular}[b]{cccc} \textbf{Level} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Level} & \textbf{Type}\\ 1-2 & I & 16-20 & V\\ 3-5 & II & 21-40 & VI \\ 6-10 & III & 41+ & Beyond the Pale\\11-15 & IV & & \\ \end{tabular}
