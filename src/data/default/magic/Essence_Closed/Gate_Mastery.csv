1,Familiar,1 animal,P,touch,U,"The caster can attune himself to a small creature (of creature intelligence) to serve as his familiar. The caster must obtain the creature through normal means (can be no more than 10\% of caster's own mass) and cast this spell on the creature once per day for 1 week (concentrating for 2 hours per day). The caster can then control the familiar and view the world through its senses by concentrating on it (though the familiar must be within 50' per level). If the creature is killed, the caster will have a -25 modification to all actions for 2 weeks."
2,Summons I,1 creature,varies,100',U,"Caster can instantly summon a first level, non- intelligent creature that he can control. If the creature can understand the caster's communication (e.g., Creature Tongues), the creature can be controlled by normal communication. Oth- erwise, control is only maintained through concentration of the caster. The general type of the creature can be specified by the caster but exactly what the creature is should be determined by the GM (selected from creatures commonly found in the area where the spell is cast). If the creature was summoned to be used for a task that is not dangerous to the creature, the duration for this spell is 10 minutes per level of the caster. However, if the creature is ever put into a dangerous situation, the duration drops to 1 round per level of the caster."
3,Companion,1 creature,varies,100',U,"The caster can make a semi-intelligent being a companion. The companion can be no more than 50\% of the caster's mass. The companion cannot be more intelligent than the caster. The relationship between the caster and the compan- ion is not magical (and the caster must strive to maintain good relations with the companion or it will leave him). The relation- ship should be treated as a parent/child relationship. The com- panion will almost always obey a ''do not'' command (e.g., ''Do not drink that potion''); but the companion may make an RR to resist a ''do'' command (e.g., ''Go steal the eggs from the chickens). The GM should determine when a command is a ''do not'' command and when a command is a ''do'' command (i.e., the commands do not have to have ''do'' or ''do not'' in themâ€”it is the intent of the command that should be exam- ined)."
5,Summons II,varies,varies,100',U,"As Summons I, except caster can also choose one of the following options: a) the level of a sum- moned creature is increased by one, b) an extra first level creature can be summoned, or c) the duration can be doubled."
6,Control Demon I,1 demon,C,10'/lvl,E,"Allows the caster to control a Type I demon for the duration of the spell. At the time of casting, there is a 2\% chance per Type of the demon that the demon can ignore the control."

8,Lesser Demonic Gate,1 demon,varies,10',U,Caster summons a demon who gradually appears over the course of d10+1 rounds. The GM should roll d100 (not open-ended) to determine the type of the demon. A result of 1-60 summons a Type I demon. A result of 61-90 summons a Type II demon. A result of 91-100 summons a Type III demon.
