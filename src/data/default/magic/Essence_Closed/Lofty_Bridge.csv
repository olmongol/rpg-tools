2,Landing *,1 target,varies,100',U,"Allows the tar- get to land safely after a fall up to 20' per level of the caster. In addition, the target may take that distance off the severity of any longer fall."
3,Leaving I,1 target,---,10',U,"Caster teleports the target to a point up to 100' away. There can be no intervening ''barriers'' in a direct line between the target and the point. A ''barrier'' is de- fined as anything the target could not physically go through (e.g., a closed door is a barrier, a pit is not)."
4,Levitation,1 target,1 min/lvl,10',U,Allows target to move up and down verti- cally at a rate of 10' per round. The spell does not confer any ability to control horizontal movement.
5,Fly II,1 target,1 min/lvl,10',U,"Target can fly at a rate of 75' per round (approxi- mately 5 mph). While Fly is active, normal movement (e.g., walking, running, etc.) is not allowed."
6,Portal,3'x6'x3',1 rnd/lvl,touch,U,"Opens a 3'x6'x3' portal in any solid surface. At the end of the duration, the surface is returned to its previous state. If anyone is in the area of effect when the spell effect ends, he is forced back to his point of entry"

8,Long Door I,1 target,---,10',U,"As Leaving I, except target can pass through barriers by specifying exact distances. If the arrival point coincides with solid or liquid material, the target does not move; instead, he is stunned 1-10 rounds (the caster still expends the PPs for this spell)."
9,Leaving III,1 target,---,10',U,"As Leaving I, except movement range is 300'."
10,Teleport I,1 target,---,10',U,"As Long Door I, except movement range is 10 miles per level. This can be very risky depending upon the caster's familiarity with the destination's locale. The following chances for failure exist: Never seen place (but has had de- scribed) = 50\%; Been briefly (one hour or less) = 25\%; Studied (been in for 24 hours) = 10\%; Studied carefully (7 days) = 1\%; Lived in (for at least one year) = .01\%. In the case of failure, first determine the direction of the error (randomly). The amount of error is then determined by making a d100 (open-ended) to determine the distance of the error in feet."
