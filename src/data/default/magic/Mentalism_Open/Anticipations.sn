When using Guess, the caster must have a limited number of options (i.e., finite and countable). After the spell is caster, the caster may not cast another Guess for the same information until his experience level has increased (See Section 7.1.4).

When dealing with Dreams, the GM may should use lots of symbology. Do not reveal straight forward answers. For example, if the character would like to know if someone in the party is going to betray them; the dream could be about an apple farmer who gathered all his apples across the season, only to discover that the barrel he was using to store them in had rotted through the bottom and he would be unable to carry his crop to town. See Section 7.1.22.
