Small rodents, they are omnivorous mammals known for long, thin tails, short legs, relatively large heads, and incredibly flexible bodies. They are quick scurriers, adept climbers, and strong swimmers. With their strong gnawing teeth and malleable bone structure, these creatures burrow their way through or into virtually any unarmored nook. Some (10%) rats produce a litter every 21-50 days. Also, some (5%) carry deadly diseases, either with their associated vermin (e.g., fleas) or internally (the latter communicated with a bite).

Celebriel hat hellbraunes Haar, graue Augen und eine sternförmige Narbe auf ihrer linken Wange.

Orvig kann seinen Gott jederzeit sehen, wenn er es will. Was könnte sich ein Priester mehr wünschen? Als Animist (6. Ivl) sind Orvig und sein Sekundant Scoel von der Gegenwart ihres Gottes so beseelt, dass sie Schmerzen (Betäubungsergebnisse) ignorieren, wenn sie in Sichtweite von Shoglic kämpfen.
Orvig ist einer der ältesten Bewohner von Hogo Tarosvan und dient als Hohepriester des Shoglic-Kultes. Er trägt standesgemäße Kleidung: lange, dunkelblaue Wollgewänder mit grauem Lederbesatz, einen schwarz-blau karierten Umhang und feine Kalbslederschuhe. Seine vollständig tätowierte Haut weist Blau- und Grüntöne auf, die in den Falten und Runzeln seines verwitterten Gesichts noch dunkler werden. Wie seine Vorfahren bleicht er sein Haar mit einer Laugenmischung, so dass es ihm zu Berge steht. Dies verleiht ihm die Illusion einer größeren Körpergröße (1,90 m, obwohl er in Wirklichkeit 1,90 m groß ist).
Orvig trägt einen Kriegshammer mit Knochengriff (+10) und einen passenden Dolch (+10) bei sich, die er beide gut werfen kann. Auf der Jagd trägt er einen (+ 5) Langbogen, die beste Bogenwaffe, die die Dorfbewohner benutzen. Er wird wird jedoch alt und zieht es vor, sich außer bei saisonalen Zeremonien in der Nähe des Butte, außer bei saisonalen Zeremonien.

Orvig heiratete in seiner Jugend, aber seine Frau starb im Kindbett. Ihr Vermächtnis waren drei Töchter und der magische Ring Claenadh. Der Ring hat nur zwei Kräfte, aber die sind wahrlich überwältigend. Der Träger kann sieben Mal am Tag unsichtbar werden (bis zu sieben Minuten lang). Dreimal am Tag (für bis zu drei Runden und niemals weniger als eine Runde pro Anwendung) kann der Träger in einen Geist verwandelt werden, ohne Substanz und ohne Angst vor Schaden durch feste Gegenstände. Beide Kräfte wirken sofort auf Kommando, und Orvig hat sie mit großer Wirkung eingesetzt.

Scoel ist der Meinung, dass andere ihre Probleme so überwinden sollten, wie er es getan hat, und leidet nicht unter der Sorge.
Scoels Handicap stört ihn nicht. Er kann problemlos einen Speer schwingen und besitzt sogar einen modifizierten Kurzbogen, den er mit seinem Arm, Armstumpf und Zähnen bedient.

Shoglic ist ein Geist, ein untoter Animist (Lvl 8). Jahrhunderte der Anbetung und lebendiger Opfer haben Shoglic zu einem Gott gemacht außer in der Tat.
Die besonderen Kräfte des Geisterpriesters sind Legion. Er ist in der Lage 2 Runden überall in seiner Höhle zu bewegen, kann der Geisterpriester jeden seiner seine klerikalen Zaubersprüche anwenden, als wäre er 14. seit seinem Tod keine Zauber mehr gelernt hat, kennt Shoglic keine Zauber über der 10. Stufe). Da er ein Geist und ohne physische Substanz ist, kann er kann er nach Belieben sichtbar und unsichtbar werden (mit 1 Rd. Konzentration); dennoch kann er kann jedoch (durch Telekinese) Gegenstände von bis zu 50 Pfund Gewicht aufheben.

Der Herr von Hogo Tarosvan ist eine furchterregende Erscheinung. Solange er sichtbar ist, müssen alle Personen im Umkreis von drei Metern einen RR machen oder in eine handlungsunfähige Trance fallen (für 1-100 Rds). Dann kann Shoglic bis zu fünf Konstitutionspunkte des Opfers pro Runde abziehen. Indem er einem Gegner in die Augen starrt (und sich konzentriert), kann der Geisterpriester ihn kontrollieren (01-100 RR-Fehler) oder sogar sein Opfer fallen (101 + RR-Fehler).
Shoglic kann auch seine Größe verändern (zwischen 5 und 9 Fuß hoch). Er manifestiert sich normalerweise als ein sieben Fuß großer Daen Coentis mit edlen Gesichtszügen, gekleidet in eine blaue Robe, die die Farbe des Felsens nachahmt, in dem er residiert. Sein Haupt, ein nackter Schädel, ist mit einer Krone aus Glasmain geschmückt. Wenn erweckt wird, wächst er auf eine Höhe von neun Fuß und seine magische Krone wird zu einem feurigen Helm. Er ignoriert Betäubungs- oder Blutungsschaden, unabhängig von seiner Veranlagung.
Shoglic trägt eine flammende (+15) Axt und einen glühenden (+15) Schild aus Glasmain. Diese führt er mit der fließenden Anmut, die einem mächtigen Ghost gebührt. Außerdem trägt er einen Dolch und einen Streitkolben (die beide Elfen und Erze töten). Selbst wenn er von diesen Waffen isoliert ist (bis zu fünfzehn Meilen), kann er die magische Essenz herbeirufen und mit diesen Eigenschaften so zuschlagen, als ob er die Gegenstände selbst in der Hand hätte (z. B. kann er das verzauberte Feuer der Axt nutzen, obwohl die physische Waffe woanders ist und er nicht mit der Klinge zuschlagen kann).

Trotz seiner großen Macht hat Shoglic keine Ahnung, woher er kommt. Seine Erinnerungen sind für immer in den schattenhaften Nebeln der Vergangenheit verloren. In seiner eigenen Vorstellung bleibt er ein Gott und Meister des Volkes hinter den Phantomtüren.

Thebo ist Scoels extravaganter Rivale und Anführer der Dunmen von Hogo Tarosvan. Mit seinen leuchtend grün karierten Leggings und dem orangefarbenen Haarhemd ist er unverwechselbar. Als einer der wenigen dieses kleinen hinterwäldlerischen Stammes, der so etwas wie ein Krieger ist, ist Thebo von dem Stolz eines jeden Sterblichen erfüllt, der weiß, dass alle seine Handlungen von seinem Gott persönlich gebilligt werden. Erfahren (4. Ivl) in der Kriegskunst, führt er Einsätze in der nahen Umgebung durch.
Diese Aufgaben befriedigen seinen Blutdurst, doch Thebo strebt nach einer höheren Position. Der Krieger zweifelt nicht daran, dass er der beste verfügbare Mann ist, um die Dorfbewohner anzuführen, und möchte sowohl Häuptling als auch Hohepriester werden. Er glaubt, dass Scoel zu alt und verkrüppelt ist, um Shoglic richtig zu dienen, und was Orvig betrifft, so hat Thebo wenig übrig für priesterliche Mätzchen, wenn sein Gott anwesend ist. Seit einem Jahr plant er im Stillen den Sturz seiner Rivalen, und er wird jeden Vorwand, jeden Aufruhr nutzen, um seinen Plan zu verbergen.

Rugged landscapes and subterranean settings accommodate this creature quite well, for the Andodaio is insulated with an unusual array of the three layers of hollow scales that enable it to survive in environments which are far too cool for its brethren. Hanging from rocks, it swings across the caves and precipices, leaping onto prey and tearing its victims appart with its steely claws. Larger creatures would have little to fear from the Andodailion, except for the fact that they live in large communities and often hunt in groups of 10-100 individuals.

'Angusaiwéli') is the most resilient, advanced, and common of the larger Rávatsar. This is due to the fact that they are, unlike any other reptile or amphibian, warm-blooded. The Angusaiwé1i constitute a unique branch of the Rávatsar and are closely related to flightless birds; thus their name. There are nine species of Angusaiwéli. All are deep grey or black in color and have bright red eyes. The only notable distinction in the family is between those that run on four legs (three species), those that run on two legs (five species), and those that hop (one species). The former group consists of the species that live near the water, especially along rocky seashores. All other Angusaiwéli have exaggerated hind legs and walk upright, using their tails for balance. Astoundingly agile, they can travel over rugged terrain at speeds exceeding 35 miles an hour. The Leaping Unbird found in Khand and Chey is the slowest of these creatures; however, they are astoundingly efficient and need less water and sustenance than other Angusaiwéli. Poisonous carnivores, Unbirds hunt lizards, frogs, birds, large insects, and small mammals. They have very sharp teeth and curving, retractable, viper-like fangs. When facing most foes, though, they bite their prey while keeping these foreteeth hidden in pockets in their upper jaw. Angusaiwéli prefer to swallow their victims whole. Against larger foes, they can bear their hollow, needle-like fangs and puncture the unfortunate beasts' hides, injecting a potent (3rd lvl) venom that immobilizes (1 -100 rds with RR failure 01-65) or kills (in 1-10 rds with RR failure of 66+). Aside from its great speed, an Angusaiwë relies on its cunning and horny body armor in combat. It has a ridge of pointed scales that protects its spine, and the scales on its back and sides are, as its name suggests, as tough as iron. NOTE: The Angusaiwéli are found on a number of ICE's covers, for they are active at all hours and savor action.",Aggressive.

Thus, a Blue Terrapin can strike like a snake, delivering a 2nd level muscle poison (with a Critical Strike) that can paralyze a small mammal (up to 40 lbs).

Green Asps have dull green skin and are usually fat and torpid, with puffy poison glands below their eyes. They are considered unattractive even by those fond of serpents. Their fetid odor, reminiscent of rotting strawberries, does nothing to relieve this unpleasant impression. The (5th lvl) bite of this snake is rarely fatal, but the area surrounding the wound generally becomes necrotic, turning awful shades of violet and yellow-green before sloughing off, usually exposing the bone. These dreadful afflictions may take months to heal. In some cases (15% chance, modified by Co stat bonus), the snake's injection may even cause the entire limb to turn gangrenous and fall off.

Prized for their value as armor (the shell makes excellent reinforcement) and (when ground) as a source of medicine to combat blood diseases and ailments, a Land Tortoise shell can bring up to two hundred gold pieces on the open market. Very slow and inoffensive, the Land Tortoise's primary defense is its size. The average specimen is five ft long and three high, weighing about three hundred pounds. A few older Tortoises, those with ages over three hundred years, have reached six ft in length and weigh over a quarter ton. In the case of an attack, Land Tortoises will retreat until cornered. If confronted by an overwhelming number of foes, they w i l l then ground themselves and pull into their shells. If it appears that they contest the attack, though, they may lash out with their necks, biting the attackers with their hard, sharp beaks. Land Tortoises feed on nearly every type of vegetation and often roam into the highlands in search of richer grass or shrubs. They mate at any time, since the males are twice as large as the females. Female Tortoises then dig holes along river banks or on the seashore, laying their (11-20) eggs and covering them with moist soil that hardens in the sun and incubates the young.

It haunts the oases between Umbar and Drel, lurking in the branches and pools that the Haradrim prize so dearly. One of Middle-earth's most fearsome reptiles, the Petla is an able hunter who has perfected the arts of camouflage and ambush. It is mottled brown in color and blends perfectly with woodland hues. Dropping from above or entangling its prey in water, the snake attacks by using its powerful jaws to gain a grip and then coils its length around its hapless victim. Petlavi reaches lengths exceeding thirty ft and at least one specimen measured forty-five ft in length. Their thickest portions are over a foot wide, and they have been known to swallow a whole goat (using their distended jaws). Petlavi like to bite; however their principal weapon is their coiling, constricting body. Whenever they take hold of prey (typically after a 'B' critical strike result), the victim has little hope of survival. From that point on, the enormously powerful body will move to coil itself around the target's body. This process takes one to ten rounds.

Appointed as overseers of all the Kelvar, they have played many glorious roles in the history of Middle-earth. Their exploits are legion. They have rescued numerous champions who were in their hour of greatest need. Both the Noldo Elf Maedhros, who was imprisoned in Thangorodrim, and Gandalf the Grey, who was confined at Orthanc by Saruman, owe their salvation to these graceful creatures. (Indeed, they also aided Gandalf after his combat with the Balrog of Moria.) Great Eagles are as intelligent as any of the Free Peoples but are not numbered among them, presumably because they lack the power to build things and fashion crafts. These huge birds are not to be trifled with, though they are fierce foes when aroused to anger and have little patience with faint-heartedness in the face of danger. They are stalwart foes of Evil and especially hate any other creature of the air who has allied with the Valar's enemies. Great Eagles confer among themselves in their own tongue, Eryr-aryth, but they can usually also speak Sindarin and some prevalent Mannish tongue(s) (e.g., Westron). Some particularly scholarly Eagles have mastered dozens of languages. 'Thorondor, Lord of the Eagles of Crissaegrim.' Thorondor was the chief of the Eagles of Beleriand in the First Age. He was a staunch friend and ally of the Edain and the Noldor. Among his noble deeds was the leading of the guard force of Eagles on Gondolin, the city of the Noldor in that Age, the rescue of Maedhros, the wounding of Morgoth himself, the recovery of the body of the Noldo Fingolfin during the Battle of the Sudden Flame (Dagor Bragollach), the rescue of Beren and Lúthien as they fled from Angband, and the leading of the Eagle forces during the Great Battle at the end of the First Age. Thorondur was allowed to go West at the end of the Age. No Great Eagle since has left such a legacy or been so powerful. His 180' wingspan made Thorondor the largest bird ever to fly over Endor, and his size enabled him to melee Dragons. 'Gwaihir Windlord, Lord of the Eagles of the Misty Mountains.' Gwaihir became a friend of Gandalf the Istar after the latter healed him of a poisoned wound. Gwaihir repaid his friend's kindness many times over as the years went by, rescuing Gandalf, Thorin Oakenshield and their companions from Wargs and Goblins (Orcs) on their way to the Lonely Mountain. The Windlord subsequently led his Eagles to the Battle of the Five Annies. He also rescued Gandalf from his imprisonment atop Isengard and later from the Peak of Zirak Zigil (Silvertine) after his battle with the Balrog. Finally, Gwaihir saved Frodo the Ringbearer and his companion Samwise from Orodruin (Mount Doom) after the destruction of the One Ring. Gwaihir's Eagles also served Gandalf and his fellow Istar Radagast as spies at their Lord's instructions. 'Landroval, Brother of Gwaihir.'

Words cannot fully describe the terror and awe of the sight of the great Balrogs (S. 'Demons of Might'; properly pl. as 'Belryg'; Q. 'Valarukar'; sing. 'Valarauko'), those evil Spirits of Fire that who were among the first allies of Morgoth in the early days of Arda. The Red Book of Westmarch describes the Balrog of Moria as: '...a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater... flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it... its swirling mane kindled and blazed behind it. In its right hand was a Made like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of many thongs... the shadow about reached out like two vast wings... Fire came from its nostrils...' — LotRI, p. 428. This fell creature was one of the last of its kind, for it is certain that although Morgoth may have won the loyalty of many of these dread Spirits of Flame in the earliest days, many were destroyed in the wars against Elves and Men. Also, there are some among the Wise who claim that there were never very many of them: 'No more than seven,' was the opinion of one old sage. Yet Balrogs, unless slain by some mighty force, are immortal, as they are true Maiar, lesser beings of the kind that made the Dwarves and caused the stars to shine. Little wonder, then, that they command such power and such awe. The powers and abilities of Balrogs are legion: they can fly; their force of will and their very presence is so great that all must quail before them, if only for a moment in the case of the valiant; they can wield a weapon in either hand so that each strikes as if wielded by a gigantic Master of Arms; they can seize control of a foe's will and mind, forcing him to do their bidding or shattering his mind beyond repair; they can burn with a fire as fierce as that of a volcano under almost any conditions, and only total immersion in a large quantity of water can douse the flames, which immediately rekindled as soon as the Balrog reaches a drier environment; they can throw certain spells with the skills of the most powerful Magician.

Immortal but unable to reproduce (or be bred), these heinous creatures possess such refined hearing and smell that they can sense things with the precision of Elven sight. Nothing surpasses them in speed or agility, for they can run along the branches of trees and leap across gaps in the woods faster than a Swift can fly. A Lassarauko can start, change direction, and stop (but only at predetermined location) virtually instantly. Lassaraukar look like tall, featureless Men. Their entire body is covered with a sort of greenish hide, a thick skin which resembles tight clothing. This covering extends over their entire body, including the face. On the feet, it is an inch thick and permeated by bizarre mole-like protrusions, 'gripper-like' soles designed to accentuate their already stunning traction. Their hairless heads are also adorned with a second outer skin. Extending down from a heavy bone brow which surrounds the Lassarauko's skull, this semi-transparent layer flaps down over their lower head, obscuring the creature's facial features. Lassaraukar pull the skin up when eating, but retreat behind its light-shielding protection at all other times. Lassaraukar normally live in 'lats' of six: five lesser led by one greater. Omnivores, they reside in dark 'nests' and live on tree products, but retain a quaint fondness for raw meat, particularly fresh brains. Their diet is ideal given their peculiar routine, for Lassaraukar are active less than an hour a day. Although they are capable of moving about for up to six hours, they prefer to rest.

One of Morgoth's earliest allies, Ungoliant rebelled against his service, for she became obsessed with light, wanting only to devour it and turn it into her own special Darkness, the Unlight, that destroyed all Light and Good things. When Morgoth later desired the Silmarilli (Great Jewels), it was no hard task for him to persuade Ungoliant to join in a raid on Valinor, for when she heard of the Jewels, she desired them for herself. She cloaked both herself and her master in her Unlight and wove webs of Darkness for them to climb into Valinor, and so they came upon the Blessed Realm in a time of festival. They then poisoned the Two Trees and fled with the Jewels. When they reached their dark refuge, they quarreled over the spoils, and Ungoliant grew in rage to such a size and might that Morgoth himself was terrified and cried out to his Balrogs to save him. The Spirits of Fire chased Ungoliant with their flaming whips, and she fled into a dark valley. There she found other creatures of her own sort, but less great, and she and they were of the shape that the Free Peoples call spiders. There she lived and mated and reproduced. Shelob (see below) was one of her brood, and there were many others, some lesser and some nearly as great.

Their teeth and claws are unusually sharp and disproportionately large, given their size, so they create quite a danger despite their inability to wield spells or breath fire. Sand Drakes have one undeniable weakness, however: they are hardly more intelligent than the snakes and lizards that share their land. These creatures live by their appetites and instincts alone. Like true Were-worms, though, Sand-drakes can magically alter their shape. They can nestle atop or beside a natural feature or some dead prey and take on the characteristics of the object they touch. In this, they function more like Cameleons than true Wereworms. since the latter consciously change their form. Insatiably hungry, they are the most active of all terrestrial Drakes. Once on the attack, a Sand Drake will viciously and tenaciously pursue its prey until either the foe or the Dragon is cloud or incapable of further combat. They attack from the air, using their powerful jaws and the talons of their muscular hind legs. Their speed and agility is such that even one Sand Drake is enough to cause great damage to a poorly guarded caravan.",,,,,/home/mongol/git/rpg-tools/src/data/default/pics_nsc/default.jpg,,nas,BUVELR,8,15-25ft
dragon,WATER-DRAKES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"True Water-drakes are often referred to as Sea Serpents (Q. 'Lingwilóki';sing.'Lingwilóke'). There are both freshwater and saltwater varieties and these hideous monsters can be found wherever the water is dark and deep. Most are deep blue or sea green in color and hard to see, particularly in the darkness. These creatures fear bright sunlight or fierce, unquenchable fires, so they rarely venture into shallows — particularly during the day. (A host of torches might cause a Water-drake to flee.) All Water-drakes are agile swimmers who are capable of moving at speeds of up to twenty knots (about twenty-one miles per hour). They move almost silently and can squeeze through very small passages in reefs or cavern systems. Using its keen senses, including a sonar-like organ like that found in porpoises, it can locate its prey under the worst conditions. Then it strikes with a burst of speed, as well as an uncanny sense of precision. After successfully stalking a potential victim, the Water-drake can seize it with its six fin-claws or stun it with a blast of expelled water (treated as a waterbolt). Should either of these methods fail to make the victim tractable, the Water-drake can then try an attack with its large mouthful of multirowed, four-inch teeth. It uses these to crush its prey into flexibility and then swallows it more or less whole. A larger victim might call for even more forceful methods: the long head and tail of the Water-drake make an effective whip or noose. (A larger Sea Serpent can even grapple and crush a small ship.) Aside from the aforementioned fear of fire, the Water-drake's one weakness is its dislike of the disorienting effects of a stunning blow.

As powerful shapechangers, they can elude, bewilder, surprise, terrify, or simply overwhelm their foes. A Were-worm can reduce or increase its size by as much as fifty percent of its mass, assuming any form it can actually see (or envision in detail) at the time it alters its shape. Most Were-worms live in the highlands of eastern Middle-earth. Their greatest concentration is in the Mountains of the Wind (Q. 'Orosúli'; S.

Its loose skin and large ears (which flap) provide the Andamunda with excellent heat regulation, enabling it to adapt to a variety of ecosystems. The creature's most notable feature, however, is undoubtedely its trunk: an enlongated nose and upper lip that serves as both a sensory organ and as a prehensile grasping tool. An Andamunda uses its trunk to smell, gather food, drink, and as a weapon in combat. Andamundar also have a pair of long tusks that they use in melees, but these giant teeth primarily serve as digging tools. Since Andamundar subsist on roots, shoots, twigs, fruit, leaves, and other edible vegetation, the tusks act as picks. A typical Andamunda eats about 400 pounds of food each day, cutting with the tusks, grasping with its trunk, and placing the food in its mouth. Aside from one or two rest periods at night and a midday break, the great beast is always active, roaming about with a swinging gait in a constant search for security and food. This continual plodding, though, belies the Andamunda's strength as a swift, agile runner. If aroused, it can run down and gore or bash a relatively quick foe. Unlike the Mûmak, the Andamunda has a slightly humped back and one (as opposed to two or three) fingerlike extension at the base of its trunk.

Growing up to thirty feet in length and standing up to 17ft in height at the shoulder, they have few foes. Fortunately for their rivals, though, Mûmakil are vegetarians. They rest in the midday heat and occasionally relax at night, but most of the time they roam in search of nutritious roots, leaves, shoots, twigs, and fruits. Using their agile trunks and huge tusks, which grow as long as 7', they can reach through narrow clefts and dig through the toughest soils. These social beasts travel in herds and adapt well (albeit reluctantly) to domestication. When aroused though, they can be deadly fighters. Both the Ûsakani and the Mûmakani have long prized them as mounts for war. Unlike lesser elephantine beasts, the Mûmak relish battle and bloodshed. The Haradrim build great fighting towers to place on the backs of these largest of domesticated beasts and decorate the legs and tusks of the Mûmakil as well. A Mûmak fully arrayed for battle is an awesome, glorious, and terrifying sight. The thick hides of Mûmakil make them almost invulnerable to arrows, except for their eyes, but when blinded in this fashion, they often run mad with pain, trampling and destroying everything in their paths.",Normal.

In harsher locales, a Zûrafa will stoop to eat grasses, and herds of the beasts have been known to devastate crops. The Nûriags, Variags, and Chey use the Zûrafy as mounts, for they are swift, fearless, and exceedingly fierce combatants.
